## Pinboard

A GTK program to copy paste from a preconfigured set of texts. Designed to be assigned to a keyboard shortcut such as CTRL + ALT + V. This is a very early build that I put together in about an hour, I plan to implement text based configuation file support in the near future to allow for the customization of the items without editing source code.
