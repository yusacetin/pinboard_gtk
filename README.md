## Pinboard

A GTK 3 program to copy paste from a preconfigured set of texts. Designed to be assigned to a keyboard shortcut such as CTRL + ALT + V. This is a very early build that I put together in about an hour, I plan to implement text based configuation file support in the ~~near~~ future to allow for the customization of the items without editing source code.

I use this on a daily basis on XFCE 4.16 and it works normally, but a friend of mine said it doesn't work on GNOME 42.
